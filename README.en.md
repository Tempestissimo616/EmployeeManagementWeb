Description: This project is a full-stack web application designed to automate user interactions through an intelligent, secure platform. The system features robust Register and Login APIs built with Spring Security and JWT, supporting role-based authorization to manage user access effectively. On the frontend, the website is styled with Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. A key component is the hierarchical review workflow, which supports single or multi-user reviews, multi-round approvals, and escalations, all secured through JWT-based permission checks. Additionally, the platform integrates the ChatGPT API to provide real-time, automated responses to user queries. This is enhanced by web scraping techniques to extract content from DOM trees, with GET/POST requests and a custom Chrome extension enabling seamless auto-login and data fetching. The project demonstrates a practical fusion of AI, backend logic, and frontend usability to deliver an efficient and interactive web-based solution.
